The python programe is compile to exe through pyinstaller
Then use NSIS to create installer based on zip file.

Since this is a A desktop application that simulates the mobile phone environment.
Meaning that a lot of features seem pointless, but the original idea was to create an actual mobile app
which is not the best choice of using Python language. Even it is still possible to create apk file
through kivy and few more other packages, the time is way too short to learn from fresh then build.

Therefore i have chosen to develop the mobile like application with Tkinter.

The exe file will not be terminated unless you click the quit button on the top of every page of the application,
simply cross out the window will leave the application continue to run at the back. In that case, you have to use
task manager to terminate the application.
